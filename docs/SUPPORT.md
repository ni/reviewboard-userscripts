# Getting Help

## Troubleshooting

- Have you tried refreshing the page?
- Are you on the latest version?
  - [Check the latest version from the top of the script file](/src/)
  - See what version you have installed ([Tampermonkey docs](http://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q101))
  - If you're out-of-date, update your userscript and then hit refresh ([Tampermonkey docs](http://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?ext=dhdg#Q101))
- Are there are any interesting errors in the JavaScript console?
  - [Documentation for most major browsers](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/how-to-find-javascript-errors-with-your-browsers-console/)
- Are you using the latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (Chromium)?
- Does it work in another browser?
- Have you disabled ad blockers / content blockers on the site? Sometimes these don't play well

If you have not yet resolved the issue or if you believe there is a bigger underlying issue, please report it.
